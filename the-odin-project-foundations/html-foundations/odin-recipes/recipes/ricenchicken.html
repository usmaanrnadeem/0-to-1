            <ol>
                <li>In a medium-sized bowl, marinate sliced chicken thighs with marinade ingredients as listed above. Set aside to marinate for 5-10 minutes.</li>
                <li>In a small bowl, combine the sauce ingredients as listed above and set aside.</li>
                <li>Heat 1 teaspoon / 5 ml of vegetable oil in a large pan on medium-high heat. Fry chicken until fully cooked. Remove from the pan.</li>
                <li>Add 1 teaspoon / 5 ml of vegetable oil into the pan. Saut√© garlic and shallots for 10 seconds. Add peas and carrots and fry for 10 seconds. Push everything to the side of the pan.</li>
                <li>Add remaining oil into empty space of the pan. Add in beaten eggs and let them sit for 20 seconds before scrambling and breaking into bite-sized pieces. Then toss everything together.</li>
                <li>Add rice and chicken and toss everything together until incorporated. Pour sauce around the rice or along the edges of the pan and let the sauce toast for 5 seconds for extra flavor before tossing. Toss everything together until all the rice grains are brown. Enjoy!</li>
