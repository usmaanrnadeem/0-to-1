            <h2>Description</h2>
            
            <p>I have shared a bunch of easy coffee recipes on the site in the past, my Iced White Chocolate Mocha, Chai Tea Latte, Pumpkin Spice Latte, and Caramel Macchiato, but this homemade mocha might be the easiest of them all.</p>
            <p>It is sweet, chocolatey, and takes hardly more time to make than adding cream and sugar to your morning coffee so it can be the thrown-together treat that gets you through a crazy busy morning or something to sip slowly on a lazy Sunday morning.</p>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            
            <ol>
                <li>In a small pot or microwave-safe cup, stir together sugar, cocoa powder, and water. Heat on the stove or in your microwave, and stir until sauce is completely smooth.</li>
                <li>Add coffee and milk and continue to heat until steaming. If making on the stove, you can whisk the mixture vigorously until foamy. Pour into a cup, top with whipped cream if desired, and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
